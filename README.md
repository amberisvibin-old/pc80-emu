# pc80-emu
An emulator for the [chibi pc80 project](https://github.com/amberisvibin/chibi-pc80).

This is very WIP, so probably don't use it.

The plan is to eventually support all features of the pc80, just as the real hardware will. I'm doing this because I do not have the resources to actually build the pc80 right now.
